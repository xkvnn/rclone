## rclone genautocomplete bash

Output bash completion script for rclone.

### Synopsis


Generates a bash shell autocompletion script for rclone.

This writes to /etc/bash_completion.d/rclone by default so will
probably need to be run with sudo or as root, eg

    sudo rclone genautocomplete bash

Logout and login again to use the autocompletion scripts, or source
them directly

    . /etc/bash_completion

If you supply a command line argument the script will be written
there.


```
rclone genautocomplete bash [output_file] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for bash
```
